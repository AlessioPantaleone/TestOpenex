## Introduction

OpenEx is an open source platform allowing organizations to plan, schedule and conduct crisis exercises. OpenEx is an [ISO 22398](http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50294) compliant product and has been designed as a modern web application including a RESTFul API and an UX oriented frontend.

## Objective

The goal is to create a powerful, reliable and open source tool to effectively plan all types of crisis management exercises. The need for rationalization and capitalization from one year to the next, as well as the publication of ISO 22398: 2013 standard necessarily lead to the need to acquire specific software. 

OpenEx aims to respond to these issues, which not only concern state services but also many private organizations. With different modules (scenarios, audiences, simulations, verification of means of communication, encryption, etc.), the platform offers advantages such as collaborative work, real-time monitoring, statistics or the management of feedback.

Finally, OpenEx supports different types of inject, allowing the tool to be integrated with emails, SMS platforms, social medias, alarm systems, etc. All currently supported integration can be found in the [OpenEx ecosystem](https://luatix.notion.site/OpenEx-Ecosystem-30d8eb73d7d04611843e758ddef8941b).

## Documentation and demonstration

If you wish to discover how the OpenEx platform is working, a [demonstration instance](https://demo.openex.io) is available and open to everyone. This instance is reset every night and is based on reference data maintained by the OpenEx developers.

### GDPR and the OpenEx OpenStreetMap server

In order to provide OpenEx users with cartography features, the platform uses a dedicated OpenStreetMap server (https://map.openex.io). To monitor usage and adapt services performances, Luatix collects access log to this server (including IP addresses).

By using this server, you authorize Luatix to collect this information. Otherwise, you are free to deploy your own OpenStreetMap server and modify the platform configuration accordingly.

If you have started using the Luatix server and change your mind, you have the right to access, limit, rectify, erase and receive your data. To exercise your rights, please send your request to gdpr@openex.io.
